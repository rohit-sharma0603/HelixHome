              This gives me immense happiness to announce that with wholehearted
              co-operation of teaching and administrative staff, we have
              successfully entered the Twelveth year under the banner of Helix
              Institute.

              Success in Medical Entrance Examinations, in face of a stiff and
              cut-throat competition, calls for a planned approach and
              cultivation of requisite skills. Developing such skills and
              attitude not only requires dedication and hard work on the part of
              students, but also proper guidance and training from mentor.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Addressing the above needs of students, we at preface, have
              crafted the exclusive study material, expose them to highly
              competitive environment, make them conceptually very strong, clear
              their doubts in totality and make them comfortable while
              attempting both competitive as well as Board examinations.

              will be prepared well to face the highly competitive entrance
              examinations.

              I am continuously making efforts to impart best education to
              students and in years to come, probably I will be able to raise
              standards of this institute up to the level that parents find it
              easy to choose this institute as best option for their ward's
              education among hub of institutes in this region.
